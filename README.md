# MindClip

A lightweight clipboard manager for macOS. Copy things, pick from your history, paste faster.

Built by **Mindact**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Copy as usual** - MindClip runs in the menu bar and quietly saves everything you copy with `⌘C`.
2. **Hold ⌘V to pick** - Tap `⌘V` to paste normally. Hold it down to open a picker overlay showing your clipboard history.
3. **Click to paste** - Select any item from the picker and it gets pasted instantly.

## Features

- **Clipboard history** - Remembers up to 200 copied items (text and images) per session
- **Screenshot capture** - Automatically detects new screenshots (⌘⇧4 / ⌘⇧3) and adds them to history
- **Image support** - Copies of images, screenshots, and photos all appear in the picker with thumbnails
- **Quick picker** - Hold `⌘V` to browse and select from history
- **Pinned favorites** - Pin frequently used snippets so they persist across sessions
- **Drag & drop** - Drag any item from the picker directly into another app
- **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to paste, 1-9 for quick paste
- **Paste as plain text** - `⇧⌘V` strips formatting and pastes clean text
- **Search** - Toggle search in the picker to filter items
- **Smart duplicates** - Optionally removes duplicate entries automatically
- **Session duration** - Auto-clears history after a set time (15 min to forever)
- **Source app labels** - See which app you copied from, with relative timestamps
- **Menu bar history** - Hover over "History" in the menu bar for quick access
- **Launch at login** - Optional auto-start when you log in
- **Lightweight** - No dock icon, no background noise, just a menu bar icon

## Install

1. Download `MindClip.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/dragon6sic6/MindClip/releases) (or build from source)
2. Unzip and drag **MindClip.app** to your Applications folder
3. Open MindClip
4. Grant **Accessibility** permission when prompted (required for `⌘V` detection)

> **Note:** macOS requires you to manually enable Accessibility access in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**. Toggle MindClip ON.
